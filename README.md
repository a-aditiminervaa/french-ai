# Pronunciation Assessment Script
## [Dedicated to French Only]
This Python script leverages eSpeak as its backend along with advanced technologies such as Google Text-to-Speech to evaluate pronunciation effectively. By breaking down spoken input into smaller phonemes and comparing them against the correct phonemes, the script calculates an accuracy score. This tool is designed to help users enhance their pronunciation skills with detailed and precise feedback.
